		<p>Welcome to Tech_planet, the place where you can contribute to the fight against pollution in nature, bringing to us phones, laptops or tablets that can no longer be used or that you want to repair.</p>
			
		<p>We want to urge people not to throw away phones that can still be used, even though they have a technical or aesthetic defect. This, by repairing an old phone, which may still be usable, it is no longer necessary to use a large amount of materials needed to produce a new phone, for example.</p>
			
		<p>About 140 million mobile phones are thrown away every year. These phones contain about 2,100 tons of copper and 3.9 tons of gold.The typical smartphone contains around 300mg of silver and 30mg of gold. It may sound like a lot, but the entire mobile phone industry is consuming about $ 2.5 billion a year.</p>
